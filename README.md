# Notes

## Secret maze 

- Space shooter
- SFX like geometry wars (vector gfx, dynamic, glow, warping, etc)
- Fast paced
- Earn/select upgrades and perks

levels
- Levels have multiple dimensions, encoded in colors
- Find secret to unlock dimension crystal
    - Have to complete level to get radar for secret (?)
    - Lead the player on: Complete “game” once by doing all the levels, but no secrets, so completion percent low
- Color dimension can be switched once the crystal was obtained
- Enemies exist in one or several dimensions
- Movement: Fast and bouncy, for speedrunning
    - Tank controls
- Zoom out the faster you go? Camera controls in the map editor?
- Regions with ‘aim lock’?
- Camera rotates in the same direction of the spaceship? (Editable in settings?)
- Weapons: Momentum-based?

Crazy Ideas
- Doppler-shifting?
- Multidimensional levels? (Continous color spectrum?)
- Time travel?
- builtin TAS

Wildcards
- 4 Colors (Mode in settings)
- Cheat Mode (Invincibility, aim assist, zero friction,…)
- Speed Run (whole movement idea, design levels with ‘straight shot’, leaderboards, timer in top right hand corner, builtin TAS3D levels saovement
