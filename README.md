# Notes

## Secret maze 

### overview
- Space shooter
- SFX like geometry wars (vector gfx, dynamic, glow, warping, etc)
- Fast paced
- Earn/select upgrades and perks

### levels
- Levels have multiple dimensions, encoded in colors
- Find secret to unlock dimension crystal
    - Have to complete level to get radar for secret (?)
    - Lead the player on: Complete “game” once by doing all the levels, but no secrets, so completion percent low
- Color dimension can be switched once the crystal was obtained
- Enemies exist in one or several dimensions
- Movement: Fast and bouncy, for speedrunning
    - Tank controls
- Zoom out the faster you go? Camera controls in the map editor?
- Regions with ‘aim lock’?
- Camera rotates in the same direction of the spaceship? (Editable in settings?)
- Weapons: Momentum-based?

#### level names
- I:    Baby Steps (movement, obstacles, goal)
- II:   Careful Now (enemies,..?)
- III:  Overpenetration (kinetic destruction)
- IV:   Green Light (speed traps)
- V:    The End? (big level, ends with open space)

### weapon ideas 
- **Laser**: 
    - Straight shot, discharges quickly
- **Missile**: 
    - Homing: Slow, follows enemies
    - Dumbfire: Fast, straight shot
- **Plasma**: 
    - Fast, high rate of fire 
    - low damage
    - bouncy? 
- **Bomb**:
    - Kills everything on screen
    - Rare
- **Shield**:
    - Absorbs damage
    - Recharges
- **EMP**:
    - Disables enemies
    - Opens doors? 
- **Mine**:
    - Explodes on contact
    - Typically part of the level, or dropped by enemies
    - Could be player controlled?

### ship control
- upgradeable engine / perks / feature select
- **hard**: turning, fwd thrust
- **difficult**: turning, fwd, backwd thrust
- **improved**: turning, fwd, backwd, side thrust
- **assisted**: mario controlls (left goes left...)

### Crazy Ideas
- Doppler-shifting?
- Multidimensional levels? (Continous color spectrum?)
- Time travel?
- builtin TAS

## Wildcards
- 4 Colors (Mode in settings)
- Cheat Mode (Invincibility, aim assist, zero friction,…)
- Speed Run (whole movement idea, design levels with ‘straight shot’, leaderboards, timer in top right hand corner, builtin TAS3D levels saovement
